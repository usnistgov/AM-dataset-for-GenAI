What is the purpose of using support structures in the printing process? 1) To print overhang geometry 2) To improve quality,to printing overhung
Which factor is directly dependent on the correct orientation?   1) Less support 2) Time to build a part,time to build a part
Which factor depends on the correct orientation?  1) Certain surfaces should be built face-up to ensure good surface finish in areas that are not in contact with support structures. 2) Certain surfaces should be built face-down to ensure good surface finish in areas that are not in contact with support structures.,whether certain surfaces should be built face-up to ensure good surface finish in areas that are not in contact with support structures
