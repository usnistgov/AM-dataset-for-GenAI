Why are process parameters important?,"Process parameters influence the quality of the final part, including dimensional accuracy, mechanical properties, and surface finish."
What is the challenge associated with using process maps for large-scale processes?,Applying process maps to large-scale processes can result in inaccurate predictions due to model extrapolation errors.
What are orientation setup rules?,Orientation setup rules refer to the guidelines to set up a part model on a build plate.
