"AMF (Additive manufacturing file) format extends the STL format to include dimensions, color, material, and many other useful features.",true
"An STL file has specific unit, color, material, or other feature information.",false
"Identifying methods, plan a sequence of operations are discussed in process planning section in additive manufacturing.",true
Orientation selection for AM process depends on the AM machine capability.,false
STL format is an advanced version of AMF format.,false
"Machine independent process planning activities include Choose Orientation, and Generate Supports.",true
Tessellated Model (MI) is supported to a build plate based on the support structure.,false
"Build Orientation and supports can affect build time, cost, dimensional accuracy, and surface quality of the final part.",true
Build orientation does not depend on support of AM process.,false
Generate support is a machine dependent phase for AM process.,false
Correct orientation of AM design may depend on which factor?   1) less support 2) time to build a part.,time to build a part
"Correct orientation of AM design may depend on which factor?  2) whether certain surfaces should be built face-up to ensure good surface finish in areas that are not in contact with support structures, 2) whether certain surfaces should be built face-down to ensure good surface finish in areas that are not in contact with support structures",whether certain surfaces should be built face-up to ensure good surface finish in areas that are not in contact with support structures
Which activity is done in machine independent process planning phase? 1) Generate Supports 2) set control parameters,Generate Supports
Tessellated Model (MI) is supported to a build plate based on  which factor? 1)support structure 2) model orientation,model orientation
Write the difference of CAD model and STL model? ,Tessellated Model is a file in STL file format which describes the external closed surfaces of the original CAD Model.
Provide some name of CAD software? ,"Solidworks, AUtoCAd, ProE"
