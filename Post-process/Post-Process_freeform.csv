Provide some methods used to enhace part properties in the post-processing phase.,"heat treating, machining, polishing, shot peening, homogenization, hardening, and quenching."
List some post-processing equipment.,"CNC milling machine, polishing equipment, heat treating machine, and  chipping tools."
What is HIP? ,HIP is a manufacturing process used to reduce the porosity of metals and increase the density of many ceramic materials. Heat treatment will enhance the part to reach the required microstructure and mechanical properties.
Why is machining operation performed? ,"To improve dimensional accuracy, metallurgical qualities, part properties, and surface quality"
What are the primary issues with AM parts that necessitate post-processing techniques?,"The primary issues include poor surface finish, unwanted microstructure phases, defects, wear tracks, reduced corrosion resistance, and reduced fatigue life."
Describe the significance of the non-equilibrium solidification process.,The non-equilibrium solidification process can be tweaked to produce desired microstructures.
What is the basis for choosing a particular post-processing technique for AM parts?,"The choice of post-processing technique depends on the specific requirements of the part, such as the need to improve surface quality or mechanical properties."
